# Age of the Crystal Ball

**A real-time observability dashboard for AI-assisted software engineering, disguised as a medieval village sim.**

---

Every Claude Code session on your machine is a villager in your village. They gather in neighborhoods around shared projects. They form districts across related work. Some are hammering away at builds. Some are deep in thought, writing code. Some are standing at attention, waiting for your command. And some have gone dark -- ghosts of sessions past.

Age of the Crystal Ball is a crystal ball -- not a command console. You don't control the village. You observe it. One glance at the isometric village tells you everything: which projects are under heavy development, which agents need your input, how long they've been waiting, and where your compute is burning.

The aesthetic is Age of Empires II meets Monument Valley meets Townscaper. Orthographic 3D, warm sandstone and sage, geometric architecture, clean shadows, procedural terrain with biomes and rivers. Day fades to night and back again. Particles drift. Water shimmers. Villagers bob and work and glow.

But underneath the charm is a genuinely useful observability tool. The Trading Floor panel shows idle economics -- how many agent-minutes you've wasted this hour. The heatmap mode turns terrain into a thermal view of CPU activity. Sparkline charts in the selection panel show activity shape over time. The idle villager alarm -- borrowed straight from AoE2 -- is the single most important notification: someone needs you.

Built for the GR Hackathon. Built to win.
